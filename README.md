# Golf_Stat_Web_Scraping

PGATour.com houses many different pages of statistical data and doesn't have major restrictions on web scraping.  This project aims to scrape stat data and explore it for fun.  I can also answer some questions that are commonly asked about the modern PGA tour: What happened to Jordan Speith? Does the golf ball go 'too far' these days? Etc.
